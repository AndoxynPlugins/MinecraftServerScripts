MinecraftServerScripts
======================

Newlanders's Minecraft Server Scripts

General Idea
============
MinecraftServerScripts are some scripts that make server administration a bit easier for us who are on linux systems.

They are written in bash, I wrote them for my own minecraft server.

Then I decided that they might be useful, so I put them here.

Installation
============
* Minecraft server - Spigot - [Spigot Install](SPIGOT-INSTALL.md)
* Minecraft server - Bukkit - [Bukkit Install](BUKKIT-INSTALL.md)
* Bungee server - BungeeCord - [Bungee Install](BUNGEE-INSTALL.md)

Usage
=====
This will be coming soon.

To start the server use `mc-start-server` for minecraft or `bc-start-server` for bungee.
