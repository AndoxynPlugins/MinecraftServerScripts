MinecraftServerScripts
======================

Newlanders's Minecraft Server Scripts

General Idea
============
MinecraftServerScripts are some scripts that make server administration a bit easier for us who are on linux systems.

They are written in bash, I wrote them for my own minecraft server.

Then I decided that they might be useful, so I put them here.

Instillation
============
* Minecraft server - Spigot - [SPIGOT-INSTALL.md](SPIGOT-INSTALL.md)
* BungeeCord server - Bungee - [BUNGEE-INSTALL.md](BUNGEE-INSTALL.md)

Usage
=====
Writing this now, coming in around 30 minutes or less.
